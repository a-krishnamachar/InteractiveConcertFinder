# Additional Info:
*APIs Used (2)*:
- **Songkick**
- **LastFM**

*Interactive Feature*:
- Our interactive feature is the content below "Related Shows" - the list of concerts that appears! Upon searching a new artist, the section **refreshes** so as not to confuse the viewer as to which artist the concerts are actually related to.

*Styling*:
- We used a color scheme as discussed in class - utilizing complementary colors (blue and orange) to keep viewers engaged and not have "eye fatigue" as they viewed our page.
- We also utilized a background image for a similar reason, and to eliminate "whitespace".

*Disclaimer*:
- We added a "N.B." section at the end so as to keep page viewers informed of the page's purpose, as well as links to ticketmaster.com and stubhub.com so they could go straight to booking artists + shows!
