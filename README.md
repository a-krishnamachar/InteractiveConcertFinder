# CSE204 - Final Project - Find Your Vibe

- Aditya Krishnamachar
- Sam Gittleman

This project is meant to help listeners discover related musical artists in concert near them!

# Usage
1. Input a city
2. Input a musical artist

    **NOTE**: Uppercase, lowercase, and even *typos* are allowed in typing. For example, if you meant to type **"Coldplay"**, but instead typed *"Coldpla"*, this would still search for **"Coldplay"**.
3. Click "SEARCH"
4. Go to a concert and *find your vibe*! (not part of the webpage ;) )

*Sample Inputs*:
- New York
- Coldplay



# Additional Info:
*APIs Used (2)*:
- **Songkick**
- **LastFM**

*Interactive Feature*:
- Our interactive feature is the content below "Related Shows" - the list of concerts that appears! Upon searching a new artist, the section **refreshes** so as not to confuse the viewer as to which artist the concerts are actually related to.

*Styling*:
- We used a color scheme as discussed in class - utilizing complementary colors (blue and orange) to keep viewers engaged and not have "eye fatigue" as they viewed our page.
- We also utilized a background image for a similar reason, and to eliminate "whitespace".

*Disclaimer*:
- We discussed with Prof Clapp about not doing the "notify me when they announce a tour" popup (described in our proposal). In his words, it would "be beyond the scope of this course as it would need passive updating and be hard to test". So we didn't include that part.
- We added a "N.B." section at the end so as to keep page viewers informed of the page's purpose, as well as links to ticketmaster.com and stubhub.com so they could go straight to booking artists + shows!
- We switched APIs from Ticketmaster/Eventbrite to **Songkick** as per Prof Clapp's suggestion.
